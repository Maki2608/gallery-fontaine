        <p class="lyney_p">A genius of a magician famed <br> throughout Fontaine.
           He moves <br>his audience with a combination<br> of sleight of hand 
           and the gift of the gab.<br> Eloquent, ingenious, and with a mind<br>
            as hard to fathom as a cat.</p>

           <p class="lynette_p"> A magician's assistant hidden in the shadows who refers to herself as a "Multi-Function Magic Assistant." Poker-faced, reticent to speak, and as unpredictable in her movements as a cat.</p>

           <p class="nevi_p"> You wouldn't exactly describe the Iudex of Fontaine as "approachable." It's hard to say whether it's just in his nature, or because he has secrets to hide. </p>

           <p class="furina_p"> The "Regina of All Waters, Kindreds, Peoples and Laws" is deeply loved by her people.She follows each and every trial held at the Opera Epiclese with an inextinguishable passion, and is always acutely aware of how the "audience" sees things. </p>
           <p class="navia_p"> Administrator of the Fortress of Meropide, he was given Fontaine's highest honorary title of "Duke." Both low-profile and dependable. </p>
           <p class="clori_p"> The mightiest Champion Duelist. Sword in hand, she defends justice in the Court of Fontaine. </p>
           <p class="sigw_p"> The head nurse of the Fortress of Meropide. As a Melusine, she uses her unique perspective to observe and care for those around her.</p>
